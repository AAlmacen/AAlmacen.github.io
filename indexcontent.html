 <p> 30 Second Script </p>
 
 <p> Hello my name is Adriene Almacen, the project i've been working on is the Lifelines breathalyzer. This breathalyzer determines a users Blood Alcohol Content
as well as their heart rate. The MQ3 Gas sensor and heart rate sensor are connected to an Adc converter which is connected to a
raspberry pi. A python script is used to read data from the GPIO pins and displays the users Blood alcohol content and beats per minute. An LED
lights up when the users Blood alcohol content or beats per minute is at a dangerous level. </p>

<H3>Week 12</H3>
<p>Individual Progress Report Due.</p>
<p>Progress Report:</p>
<p>
This week, I am attempting to assemble a case for my hardware project. I also have received my heart rate sensor. I calibrated the heart rate sensor to read data and display the heart rate. In addition, I plan on using the LED on the PCB board that was built in my project. The LED color will correspond to the alcohol test and heart rate test.
As for the next milestone, I plan on having my case for my project ready, my build log, properly calibrated sensors, and a working LED that corresponds to the data from the sensors. 
The only problem that I am currently having is the creation of the case. 
Financially, nothing was purchased.

 <p> Individual Progress report due.</p>
 <p>Progress Report:</p>
 <p> 
 In the past week, I have attended the open house at Humber which was scheduled on Nov 12. I have demonstrated my breathalyzer project to future students and their guardians. I received feedback and suggestions regarding my project. Which includes, calibrating my sensors to display a more accurate value. Display one more digit to get an accurate reading for my alcohol sensor. As well as finding the average alcohol level.

In the following week I plan on adding all the suggestions and feedback I received at the open house. 
I also plan on brushing up any faults in my project. I also plan on working on my individual presentation for next week. I also plan on creating an acrylic case.
The problems that have occurred in my project is that my heart rate sensor still has yet to arrive.  
Since the heart rate sensor has yet to arrive, I  plan on buying one this Wednesday. I also plan on getting a better alcohol sensor.

 <p> Individual Progress report due.</p>
 <p>Progress Report:</p>
 <p> 
 These past weeks i have been able to complete the Placard for our project and my build video. This week for my project I currently have the ability to ssh into my raspberry pi and view it on my laptop. As of today my heart rate sensor has still yet to arrive in the mail.
 I am currently working on the program to get a reading from the alcohol sensor. If the heart rate sensor arrives before open house I will try to get a program running that will read from the heart rate sensor.
 As stated earlier, the only problem that I am having right now is that the heart rate sensor has yet to arrive.
 If the heart rate sensor does not arrive a week after open house. A new heart rate sensor will be bought.

	<p> This week progress report was due. An update on what hardware project was done.
	<p>Progress Report:</p>
	As of today I am a bit behind on the pcb board but caught up on the hardware for the breathalyzer project. Most of the parts for the breathalyzer have arived in the mail with the exception of the heart rate sensor. Raspberry Pi basic setup has been completed. As for the pcb I will be coming in tomorrow to work on the pcb to catch up.
	The Raspberry pi was assembled inside it's case and the breadboard layout for where the breathalyzer will be tested as been set up. The heartrate monitor is still on its way so I was unable to set up anything for it.
	Currently no major problems have occured. Other than the heartbeat sensor not arriving yet. We meet with Kristian Mendri and plan to collaborate with one of the schools program Hospitality, Recreation and Tourism. We also decided to include a heartbeat sensor in our project.
	As of financial status we currently have ordered everything that is needed. Currently nothing else is to be bought. Any future products that are bought will be added in the following weeks.</p>

    <li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
	<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
	<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a

	<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login at: <a
